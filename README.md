## Scraping and analysing the housing market of copenhagen

The `Rscript.R` file contains everything as of now, but that might change in the future. I scrape the danish online housing marketplace [boliga](boliga.dk) for hitorical trade price data.

## Usage
This project relies on a number of very large data files, including a national adress registry and a city shapefile - to get access to these you can contact me directly, as storing them on github would take upto much space.
